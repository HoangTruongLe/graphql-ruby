  module Execution
    # Implement query execution as an AST visitor.
    #
    # Goals:
    # - No rewrite required, low memory/time overhead
    # - Customizeable via redefining methods
    # - Implement lazy_resolve, support null propagation, etc.
    #
    # Non-Goals:
    # - Compatibility with analyzers
    # - Compatibility with `irep_node` ðŸ˜¿
    #
    # Instead, analysis will be implemented as a separate pass over the AST.
    #
    # Previously, look-ahead was done with the irep_node. Now,
    # we need some way to do that with method overrides.
    #
    # The interpreter is going to be the centralized host
    # of runtime caches like fragment spreads and
    # prepared argument values.
    #
    # Somehow, those cached values should be shared
    # between passes over the tree.
    #
    # TODO: could it be made into a straight-up AST visitor?
